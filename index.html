            <article>
                <p> Originally devised to enhance web pages in Netscape 2.0, JavaScript is now faced with being a
                    single-threaded language in a multimedia, multitasking, multicore world. Yet JavaScript has not only
                    persevered since 1995, it’s thrived. One after the other, potential rivals in the browser—Flash,
                    Silverlight, and Java applets, to name a few—have come and (more or less) gone.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, when a programmer named Ryan Dahl wanted to build a new framework for event-driven
                    servers, he
                    searched the far reaches of computer science for a language that was both dynamic and
                    single-threaded
                    before realizing that the answer was right in front of him. And so, Node.js was born, and JavaScript
                    became a force to be reckoned with in the server world.</p>
                <p>How did this happen? As recently as 2001, Paul Graham wrote the following in his essay <q>The Other
                        Road
                        Ahead</q>: 1 <blockquote>I would not even use JavaScript, if I were you... Most of the
                        JavaScript I
                        see on the Web isn’t necessary, and much of it breaks.</blockquote>
                    <p>Today, Graham is the lead partner at Y Combinator, the investment group behind Dropbox, Heroku,
                        and
                        hundreds of other start-ups—nearly all of which use JavaScript. As he put it in a revised
                        version of
                        the essay, <q>JavaScript now works</q>.</p>
                    <p>When did JavaScript become a respectable language? Some say the turning point was Gmail (2004),
                        which
                        showed the world that with a heavy dose of Ajax you could run a first-class email client in the
                        browser. </p>
                    <p> Whatever the reason, JavaScript is here to stay. Apple got behind JavaScript with WebKit and
                        Safari.
                        Microsoft is getting behind JavaScript with Metro. Even Adobe is getting behind JavaScript with
                        tools to generate HTML5 instead of Flash. What began as a humble browser feature has become
                        arguably
                        the most important programming language in the world.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the ubiquity of web browsers, JavaScript has come closer than any other language to
                        fulfilling Java’s old promise of <q>write once, run any- where.</q>In 2007, Jeff Atwood coined
                        Atwood’s law:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trouble in Paradise</li>
                        <p>JavaScript was conceived to be a single-threaded language where asyn- chronous tasks are
                            handled
                            with events. When there are only a few potential events, event-based code is much simpler
                            than
                            multithreaded code.</p>
                        <p>It’s con- ceptually elegant, and it eliminates the need to wrap up data in mutexes and
                            semaphores
                            to make it thread-safe. But when a number of events are expected, with state that needs to
                            be
                            carried from one event to the next, that simplicity often gives way to a code structure so
                            terrifying that it’s been dubbed the Pyramid of Doom.</p>.
                        <code> step1(function(result1) { step2(function(result2) { step3(function(result3) { // and so on... }); }); }); </code>
                        <p> “I love async, but I can’t code like this,” one developer famously complained on the Node.js
                            Google Group. 4 But the problem isn’t with the language itself; it’s with the way
                            programmers
                            use the language. Dealing with complex sets of events in an elegant way is still frontier
                            territory in JavaScript </p>
                        <li>Who Is This Book For?</li>
                        <p> This book is aimed at intermediate JavaScripters. You should know how variables are scoped.
                            Keywords like typeof , arguments , and this shouldn’t faze you. Perhaps most importantly,
                            you
                            should understand that<code>func(function(arg) { return next(arg); });</code>is just a
                            needlessly verbose way of writing<code>func(next);</code> except in rare cases. (See Reg
                            Braithwaite’s excellent article “Captain Obvious on JavaScript” for more examples of small
                            but
                            important functional idioms.) <p>What you don’t need to know is how asynchronous events are
                                scheduled in JavaScript. We’ll cover that in the next chapter </p>

            <header>Understanding JavaScript Events</header>
            <p> Events. How do they work? Confusion about JavaScript’s asynchronous event model is as old as JavaScript
                itself. Confusion leads to bugs, bugs lead to anger, and Yoda taught us the rest....</p>
            <p> Yet at heart, JavaScript events are both conceptually elegant and practical.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve accepted the language’s single-threaded design, it feels like a feature rather than a
                limitation.
                It means that your code is uninterruptible and that the events you schedule line up in an orderly
                fashion.
            </p>
            <p>In this chapter, we’ll take a tour of JavaScript’s asynchronous mechanisms and dispel some common
                misconceptions. We’ll see what setTimeout really does.</p>
            <p>Then we’ll discuss handling errors in callbacks. Finally, we’ll set up the main theme of this book:
                organizing async code for clarity and maintainability. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduling Events <p>When we want to make a piece of code run in the future in JavaScript, we put it
                        in
                        a callback. A callback is just an ordinary function, except that it’s passed to a function like
                        setTimeout or bound as a property like document.onready . When a callback runs, we say that an
                        event
                        (e.g., the timeout elapsing or the document becoming ready) has fired.</p>
                    <p>But as we’ll see in this section, and throughout this chapter, that description is seriously
                        flawed.
                        In most cases, it’s only approximately true. In others, it’s flat-out wrong. To truly understand
                        setTimeout , we have to understand the JavaScript event model as a whole</p>
                </li>
                <li>Now or Later? <p> To begin our exploration of <code>setTimeout</code> , let’s look at a simple
                        example
                        of a situ- ation that often mystifies new JavaScripters, especially those coming from
                        multithreaded
                        languages like Java and Ruby </p>
                    <code> for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) { setTimeout(function(){ console.log(i); }, 0); }; </code>
                <li> There’s only one variable named i , scoped by the declaration var i (which, incidentally, scopes it
                    not
                    within the loop but within the closest function containing the loop). </li>
                <li>After the loop, <code>i === 4</code> , having been incremented until it failed the condition
                    <code> i <= 3 </code> .</li>
                <li>JavaScript event handlers don’t run until the thread is free.</li>
                </li>
                <li>Blocking the Thread <p>This piece of code demolished my preconceptions about JavaScript events:</p>
                    <code>var start = new Date; setTimeout(function(){ var end = new Date; console.log('Time elapsed:', end - start, 'ms'); }, 500); while (new Date - start < 1000) {};</code>
                    <p>In my multithreaded mind-set, I’d expected only 500ms to go by before the timed function ran. But
                        that would have required the loop, designed to last a full second, to be interrupted. Instead,
                        if
                        you run the code, you’ll get something like this:</p>
                    <p>You’ll probably get a slightly different number; <code>setTimeout</code> and
                        <code>setInterval</code>
                        are, alas, a lot less precise than you’d hope <a href="#"> (see Timing Functions</a>, on page
                        5).
                        But it will definitely be at least 1000 , because the setTimeout callback can’t fire until the
                        while
                        loop has finished running. So, if <code>setTimeout</code> isn’t using another thread, then what
                        is
                        it doing?</p>
                </li>
                <li>Meet the Queue</li>
                <p>When we call setTimeout , a timeout event is queued. Then execution continues: the line after the
                    setTimeout call runs, and then the line after that, and so on, until there are no lines left. Only
                    then
                    does the JavaScript virtual machine ask, “What’s on the queue?” If there’s at least one event on the
                    queue that’s eligible to “fire” (like a 500ms timeout that was set 1000ms ago), the VM will pick one
                    and
                    call its handler (e.g., the function we passed in to setTimeout ). When the handler returns, we go
                    back
                    to the queue.</p>
                <p>Input events work the same way: when a user clicks a DOM element with a click handler attached, a
                    click
                    event is queued. But the handler won’t be executed until all currently running code has finished
                    (and,
                    potentially, until after other events have had their turn). That’s why web pages that use
                    Java-Script
                    imprudently tend to become unresponsive.</p>
                <p>You might sometimes hear the term event loop used to describe how the queue works. It’s as if your
                    code
                    is being run from a loop that looks like this:</p>
                <code> runYourScript(); while (atLeastOneEventIsQueued) { fireNextQueuedEvent(); }; </code>
                <p>The ease of event scheduling in JavaScript is one of the language’s most powerful features. Async
                    functions like setTimeout make delayed execution simple, without spawning threads. JavaScript code
                    can
                    never be interrupted,because events can be queued only while code is running; they can’t fire until
                    it’s
                    done.</p>
                <li>Un-nesting Callbacks <p>The most common anti-pattern in JavaScript is nesting callbacks within
                        callbacks. Remember the Pyramid of Doom from the introduction? Let’s look at a concrete example
                        that
                        you might see in a Node server.</p>
                    <code> function checkPassword(username, passwordGuess, callback) { var queryStr = 'SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = ?'; db.query(selectUser, username, function (err, result) { if (err) throw err; hash(passwordGuess, function(passwordGuessHash) { callback(passwordGuessHash === result['password_hash']); }); }); } </code>
                    <p>Here we’ve defined an async function ( checkPassword ), which fires another async function (
                        db.query
                        ), which potentially fires another async function ( hash ). (It’s impossible to know for certain
                        whether these functions are async without actually reading their code, but it’s reasonable to
                        assume
                        so here.)</p>
                    <p>What’s the problem with this code? Right now, nothing. It works, and it’s succinct. But it’s
                        going to
                        get awfully hairy when we try to add new features to it, like handling that database error
                        instead
                        of throwing it (see To Throw or Not to Throw?, on page 16), logging access attempts, throttling,
                        and
                        so on.</p>
                    <p>Nested callbacks tempt us to add more features by adding more code, rather than implementing
                        those
                        features in manageable, reusable pieces. This equivalent implementation of
                        <code>checkPassword</code> avoids that temptation:</p>
                    <code>function checkPassword(username, passwordGuess, callback) { var passwordHash; var queryStr = 'SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = ?'; db.query(selectUser, username, queryCallback);</code>
                    <code>function checkPassword(username, passwordGuess, callback) { var passwordHash; var queryStr = 'SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = ?'; db.query(selectUser, username, queryCallback);</code>
                    <code>function queryCallback(err, result) { if (err) throw err; passwordHash = result['password_hash']; hash(passwordGuess, hashCallback); }</code>
                    <code>function hashCallback(passwordGuessHash) { callback(passwordHash === passwordGuessHash); } }</code>
                    <p>This approach is more verbose, but it reads more clearly and is much easier to extend. Because
                        we’ve
                        given the async result ( passwordHash ) broader scope, we have more flexibility.</p>
                    <p>As a rule, avoid more than two levels of function nesting. The key is to figure out a way of
                        storing
                        async results outside of the function making the async call so that the callback doesn’t have to
                        be
                        nested.</p>
                    <p>If all of this sounds tricky, don’t worry. We’ll see plenty of examples in later chapters of
                        async
                        events running in sequence without nested handlers.</p>

                        should
                        we handle those events? <p>That may sound like a silly question. Just attach a handler to each
                            event
                            your app cares about, right? But when a single event has several conse- quences, the “one
                            event,
                            one handler” approach forces handlers to grow to gargantuan proportions. <p>Let’s say you’re
                                building a web-based word processor like Google Docs. <p> Every time a user presses a
                                    key, a
                                    number of things need to happen: the new character has to be displayed on the
                                    screen,
                                    the caret has to be moved, the action has to be pushed to the local undo history and
                                    synced to the server, spell-check may have to run, and the word count and page count
                                    may
                                    need to be updated. Carrying out all of these tasks and more from a single keypress
                                    handler is a daunting proposition.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>PubSub <p>Since the dawn of JavaScript, browsers have allowed event handlers to
                                            be
                                            attached to DOM elements like so:</p>
                                        <code>link.onclick = clickHandler;</code>
                                        <p>Ah, simplicity itself! There’s just one caveat: if you wanted two click
                                            handlers
                                            for an element, you’d have to aggregate them yourself with a wrapper
                                            function.
                                        </p>
                                        <code>link.onclick = function() { clickHandler1.apply(this, arguments); clickHandler2.apply(this, arguments); };</code>
                                        <p>Not only is this tedious, it’s also a recipe for bloated, all-purpose handler
                                            functions. That’s why the W3C added addEventListener to the DOM
                                            specification in
                                            2000 and jQuery abstracted it with the bind method. bind makes it easy to
                                            add as
                                            many handlers as you like to any event on any element (or set of ele-
                                            ments),
                                            without worrying about stepping on anyone else’s toes.</p>
                                        <code>$(link) .bind('click', clickHandler1) .bind('click', clickHandler2);</code>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>EventEmitter <p> Let’s use Node’s EventEmitter as an example of a PubSub
                                            interface.
                                            It has a simple, nearly minimal design.</p>
                                        <p>To add an event handler to an EventEmitter , just call on with the event type
                                            and
                                            the handler. </p>
                                        <code>emitter.on('evacuate', function(message) { console.log(message); });</code>
                                        <p>The emit method will call all handlers for the given event type. For
                                            instance,
                                            the following<code>emitter.emit('evacuate');</code>would call all evacuate
                                            handlers</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Roll Your Own PubSub <p> PubSub implementations are so simple that we can create
                                            one
                                            in about a dozen lines of code. The only state we need to store is a list of
                                            handlers for each event type we support</p>
                                        <code>PubSub = {handlers: {}}</code>
                                        <p>When we add a listener, we push it to the end of the array (which means that
                                            listeners will always be called in the order in which they were added).</p>
                                        <code>PubSub.on = function(eventType, handler) { if (!(eventType in this.handlers)) { this.handlers[eventType] = []; } this.handlers[eventType].push(handler); return this; }</code>
                                        <p>Then when an event is emitted, we loop through all of our handlers.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <code>PubSub.emit = function(eventType) { var handlerArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1); for (var i = 0; i < this.handlers[eventType].length; i++) { this.handlers[eventType][i].apply(this, handlerArgs); } return this; }</code>
                                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Promises_and_Deferreds">
            <header>Promises and Deferreds</header>
            <p> Thankfully, jQuery 1.5 changed Mr. Ajax’s need-it-now attitude. All of the Ajax functions you know and
                love
                ( $.ajax , $.get , and $.post ) now return Promises. A Promise is an object that represents a task with
                two
                possible outcomes (success or failure) and holds callbacks that fire when one outcome or the other has
                occurred. For example, under jQuery 1.4, I’d have had to write this: </p>
            <code>$.get('/mydata', { success: onSuccess, failure: onFailure, always: onAlways });</code>
            <p>You might wonder what’s so great about this change. Why would you want to attach a callback after an Ajax
                call has fired? In a word: encapsulation.</p>
            <p>If an Ajax call has multiple effects (triggering animations, inserting HTML, locking/unlocking user
                input,
                and so on), it’s awkward for the part of your app that’s making the request to handle all of them.</p>
            <p>It’s much more elegant to pass a Promise around. By passing a Promise, you’re announcing, “Something you
                might be interested in is happening.</p>
            <p>If you want to find out when it’s done, just give this Promise a callback.” And like an EventEmitter , a
                Promise allows you to bind handlers to the same event as many times as you like (stacking). <p>That
                    makes it
                    a lot easier to reduce code duplication when some small piece of functionality (like a “Loading”
                    animation) is shared across several Ajax calls.</p>
                <p>But the biggest advantage of using Promises is that you can easily derive new Promises from existing
                    ones. You might ask two Promises representing parallel tasks to give you a Promise that will inform
                    you
                    of their mutual completion. Or you might ask a Promise representing the first task in a series to
                    give
                    you a Promise representing the final task in the series. As we’ll soon see, these operations come
                    naturally with Promises</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making Promises <p>We started this chapter by showing how the Ajax methods in jQuery 1.5+
                            <code>( $.ajax , $.get , and $.post )</code> return Promises. But to really understand
                            Promises,
                            we need to make a few of our own.</p>
                        <p>Let’s give the user a prompt to hit either Y or N . The first thing we’ll do is create an
                            instance of $.Deferred that represents the user’s decision.</p>
                        <code>var promptDeferred = new $.Deferred(); promptDeferred.always(function(){ console.log('A choice was made:'); }); promptDeferred.done(function(){ console.log('Starting game...'); }); promptDeferred.fail(function(){ console.log('No game today.'); });</code>
                        <p>(Note: always is available only in jQuery 1.6+.)</p>
                        <p>You’re probably wondering why I created an instance of Deferred when this section is called
                            “Making Promises.” Fear not—a Deferred is a Promise! More precisely, it’s a superset of
                            Promise
                            with one critical addition: you can trigger a Deferred directly. A pure Promise only lets
                            you
                            add more callbacks; someone else has to trigger them.</p>
                    </li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Multithreading_with_Workers">
            <header>Multithreading with Workers</header>
            <p>At the start of this book, I described events as an alternative to multithreading.</p>
            <p>More precisely, events replace a specific kind of multithreading, the kind where multiple parts of an
                application process run simultaneously (either virtually, through interrupts, or physically on multiple
                CPU
                cores).</p>
            <p>This gets to be a problem when code running in different threads has access to the same data. Even a line
                as
                simple as <code>i++;</code>
                <p>can be a source of pernicious Heisenbugs 1 when it allows separate threads to modify the same i at
                    the
                    same time.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, this kind of multithreading is impossible in JavaScript.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, distributing tasks across multiple CPU cores is increas- ingly essential because
                    those
                    cores are no longer making the same exponential gains in efficiency, year after year, that used to
                    be
                    expected. So, we need multithreading. Does that mean abandoning event-based programming?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web Workers <p>Web workers are part of the living standard widely known as HTML5. To create one,
                            you
                            call the global Worker constructor with the URL of a script. </p>
                        <code>var worker = new Worker('worker.js'); worker.addEventListener('message', function(e) { console.log(e.data); // echo whatever was sent by postMessage })</code>
                        <p>(Usually, we want only the data property from the message event. If we were binding the same
                            event handler to multiple workers, we could use e.target to determine which worker emitted
                            the
                            event.)</p>
                        <p>So, now we know how to listen to workers. Conveniently, the interface for talking to workers
                            is
                            symmetrical: we use worker.postMessage to send it, and the worker uses
                            <code>self.addEventListener</code>('message', ...) to receive it. Here’s a complete example:
                        </p>
                        <code> // master script var worker = new Worker('boknows.js'); worker.addEventListener('message', function(e) { console.log(e.data); }); worker.postMessage('football'); worker.postMessage('baseball'); // boknows.js self.addEventListener('message', function(e) { self.postMessage('Bo knows ' + e.data); }); </code>
                        <p>You can play with the message-passing interface at a little site I created, the Web Worker
                            Sandbox. 2 Any time you create a new example, it gets a unique URL that you can share.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Async_Script_Loading">
            <header>Async Script Loading</header>
            <p>In the beginning, there was this: <p> <code><script src="allMyClientSideCode.js"></script></code> And it
                    was...not great. “Where should it go?” developers wondered. “Up in the ? Or down in the ?” For
                    script-heavy sites, both options lead to misery. A large script in the delays all page rendering,
                    giving
                    the user a “White Screen of Death” 1 until the script loads completely. But a large script at the
                    end of
                    this gives the user a lifeless, static page littered with nonworking controls and empty boxes where
                    client-side rendering is supposed to occur.</p>
                <p>The ideal solution to this problem is to triage your scripts; those that are needed for the page to
                    look
                    and feel right should load right away. Scripts that can wait should. But what’s the right way of
                    delaying those scripts while ensuring that they’re available when called?</p>

                <p>In the last few years, several technologies aimed at solving this problem have become widespread. In
                    this
                    chapter, we’ll look at how HTML5’s async and defer attributes can help. We’ll also look at two
                    popular
                    script-loading libraries: yepnope and Require.js. </p>
